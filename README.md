# Text Analysis for Mental Health

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that analyzes text data from mental health-related posts on social media. The primary objective is to identify patterns and sentiments in the text data that could help in understanding and predicting mental health conditions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the **Dreaddit** dataset, which includes posts from various subreddits related to mental health. The dataset contains attributes such as subreddit, post_id, sentence range, text, label, and other linguistic features.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `nltk`
- `seaborn`
- `textblob`
- `scikit-learn`
- `wordcloud`

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib nltk seaborn textblob scikit-learn wordcloud
```

## Contents

The notebook is divided into several sections:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Importing necessary libraries for data processing and visualization.
2. **Loading Data**: Loading the dataset and displaying the first few rows to understand its structure.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the text data, handling missing values, and preparing the data for analysis.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and relationships between features.
5. **Sentiment Analysis**: Performing sentiment analysis using TextBlob and VADER.
6. **Topic Modeling**: Applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling.
7. **Results**: Summarizing the findings and visualizations.

## Usage

To run the notebook, simply clone this repository and open `Text analysis for mental health.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. You can execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
jupyter notebook "Text analysis for mental health.ipynb"
```

## Results

The results of the analysis are summarized as follows:

- **Sentiment Analysis**: The sentiment analysis revealed that the majority of posts had a neutral to negative sentiment, indicating a prevalence of discussions related to negative experiences and emotions.
- **Topic Modeling**: The LDA model identified several key topics, including anxiety, depression, therapy, and medication. These topics provide insights into the primary concerns and discussions within the mental health community.
- **Visualization**: Word clouds and bar plots were used to visualize the most common words and topics, helping to identify key themes and patterns in the data.
